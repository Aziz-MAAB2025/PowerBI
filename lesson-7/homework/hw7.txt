📁 Step 1: Import the Dataset

File: Retail_Sales_Data.xlsx

Steps:

Open Power BI Desktop.

Go to Home → Get Data → Excel.

Select your file Retail_Sales_Data.xlsx.

Choose the worksheet containing your data (e.g., Sheet1).

Click Load.

🧾 Example Data Loaded
OrderID	Date	Product	Region	Sales	Profit
2001	1/1/2023	Laptop	North	1200	300
2002	1/5/2023	Mouse	South	125	25
2003	1/10/2023	Keyboard	East	80	15
📊 Step 2: Create a Table Visual (Region and Sales)

In Report View, select Table visual.

Drag Region → Values.

Drag Sales → Values.
✅ You now have a simple table showing total Sales per Region.

🎛 Step 3: Add a Slicer for Product

Select the Slicer icon from the Visualizations pane.

Drag Product into the slicer’s field well.

Users can now filter the entire page by selecting specific products.

🎨 Step 4: Format Dashboard Theme to “Dark Mode”

Go to View → Themes → Dark (or choose Customize current theme).

Select darker background colors and lighter text for visual contrast.

🧠 Step 5: What is the purpose of the Data/Model View?
View	Purpose
Data View	Lets you inspect and clean your imported data (view columns, apply transformations).
Model View	Shows relationships between tables (one-to-many links, cardinality). It’s essential for combining multiple tables or enabling cross-filtering between visuals.
📈 Step 6: Build the Dashboard
🟩 a) Bar Chart – Sales by Region

Add a Clustered Bar Chart.

Drag Region → Axis.

Drag Sales → Values.
→ Shows total sales per region.

🟦 b) Line Chart – Sales over Date

Add a Line Chart.

Drag Date → X-axis.

Drag Sales → Y-axis.
→ Shows sales trend over time.

🟨 c) Card – Total Profit

Add a Card visual.

Drag Profit → Fields.
→ Displays the total Profit value at a glance.

🔁 Step 7: Add a Drill-through Filter (Region → Detail Page)

Create a new report page → name it “Region Detail.”

Add a Drill-through filter (drag Region into the Drill-through field well).

Add visuals to show sales by product or date.

On your main dashboard, right-click a region → choose Drill-through → Region Detail.
→ Takes you to the detailed page filtered by that region.

🌈 Step 8: Use Conditional Formatting for High-Profit Regions

Select the Table visual.

Click Format → Conditional formatting → Background color (or Font color).

Choose Based on field: Profit.

Define a color gradient (e.g., green for high profit, red for low).

☁️ Step 9: Publish to Power BI Service

Save the file.

Click Publish (Home tab).

Select your Power BI Workspace.
✅ The report is now online in Power BI Service.

👥 Step 10: Share with a Colleague (Simulated Steps)

In Power BI Service, open your published report.

Click Share → enter your colleague’s email (must have Power BI license or access).

Choose Allow reshare / build permissions (if needed).

Click Send.

⚙️ Step 11: Add a Custom “Sales Growth %” Measure (Quick Measure)

Without DAX, use Quick Measures:

Go to Modeling → New Quick Measure.

Choose Calculation: Division.

Set Numerator: This year’s Sales (or a field), Denominator: Previous year’s Sales.

Rename the result as Sales Growth %.
✅ This auto-generates DAX for you.

⚡ Step 12: Optimize Dataset for Faster Refresh

Remove unused columns (Model View → Right-click column → Delete).

Disable Auto date/time if not needed.

Use Import Mode instead of DirectQuery.

Compress data types (e.g., use Whole Number for IDs, Date for date fields).

🧩 Step 13: Troubleshoot – Slicers Not Affecting All Visuals

Cause: Visual interactions are off.
Fix:

Select the slicer.

Go to Format → Edit Interactions.

Ensure Filter (not None) is selected for all visuals.
→ Now slicer filters every visual correctly.

🖼 Step 14: Embed Dashboard into PowerPoint

In Power BI Service → Open your report.

Click Share → Export → PowerPoint → Embed live data.

This adds a live, interactive Power BI report slide (updates automatically).

⏰ Step 15: Schedule Dataset Refresh

In Power BI Service, go to Datasets → Schedule refresh.

Set refresh frequency (daily, hourly, etc.).

Configure gateway connection if data is on-premise.
✅ Keeps your dashboard up to date automatically.
