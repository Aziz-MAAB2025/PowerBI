1. What is Power BI, and what are its three main components?

Power BI is a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft that allows users to visualize data, share insights, and make data-driven decisions.
Three main components:

Power BI Desktop: A Windows application used to create reports and data models.

Power BI Service (Cloud): An online SaaS platform for sharing and collaborating on reports.

Power BI Mobile: Mobile apps for viewing and interacting with reports on smartphones and tablets.

2. Name two business use cases for Power BI dashboards.

Sales Performance Tracking: Visualizing revenue trends, regional sales, and top-performing products.

Financial Reporting: Monitoring expenses, profit margins, and budget utilization in real time.

3. How do you download and install Power BI Desktop?

Visit the Microsoft Power BI website
 or the Microsoft Store.

Click Download Power BI Desktop.

Run the installer (PBIDesktopSetup.exe) and follow the setup instructions.

4. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?
Feature	Power BI Desktop	Power BI Service
Platform	Windows application	Cloud-based (web)
Purpose	Data modeling and report creation	Sharing, collaboration, and dashboards
File Format	.pbix	Hosted reports and dashboards
Usage	Developer-oriented	Viewer and collaboration-oriented
5. What file extension does a Power BI project use?

Power BI project files use the .pbix extension.

6. Explain the role of Power Query in Power BI.

Power Query is a data connection and transformation tool within Power BI.
It allows users to:

Import data from multiple sources (Excel, SQL, APIs, etc.)

Clean, merge, and reshape data using a visual interface.

Automate data preparation steps for analysis.

7. Why would a business prefer Power BI over Excel for reporting?

Interactive visualizations instead of static tables.

Automatic data refresh and real-time dashboards.

Better collaboration through Power BI Service.

Handles larger datasets more efficiently than Excel.

Built-in AI features for insights and anomaly detection.

8. Describe one limitation of the free version of Power BI.

The free version doesn’t support sharing reports and dashboards with others via the Power BI Service — collaboration requires a Power BI Pro or Premium license.

9. What is a "published report" in Power BI Service?

A published report is a Power BI report that has been uploaded from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service.
It allows users to:

View and interact with it online.

Share it with team members.

Pin visuals to dashboards for monitoring.

10. How does Power BI Mobile enhance accessibility?

Enables users to access dashboards and reports anytime, anywhere.

Offers touch-friendly navigation and real-time updates.

Supports offline viewing for downloaded reports.

Push notifications for data alerts.

11. Compare Power BI with Tableau — pros and cons.
Feature	Power BI	Tableau
Ease of Use	Easier for beginners (Microsoft ecosystem)	Steeper learning curve
Cost	More affordable	More expensive
Integration	Seamless with Office 365, Azure	Works well with diverse data sources
Visualization	Good but slightly limited customization	Superior visualization flexibility
Performance	Excellent for Microsoft data	Strong for big and diverse data
Community	Growing	Mature and large
12. Explain how Power BI integrates with Azure services.

Power BI integrates deeply with Azure to enhance analytics and AI:

Azure Synapse / SQL Database: As data sources for analysis.

Azure Machine Learning: For predictive modeling.

Azure Data Lake Storage: For storing and accessing large datasets.

Azure Active Directory (AAD): For user authentication and role-based access.

13. What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?

A Power BI Gateway acts as a bridge between on-premises data sources and the Power BI Service.
They are needed when:

Your data is stored locally (e.g., SQL Server, Excel on a server).

You want scheduled data refreshes in the cloud.
Types:

Personal Gateway – for individual use.

Enterprise Gateway – for shared, organization-wide access.

14. How would you convince a company to adopt Power BI? (ROI argument)

Power BI delivers high ROI because:

It reduces manual reporting time with automation.

Improves decision-making through real-time insights.

Low cost compared to other BI tools.

Quick deployment using existing Microsoft infrastructure.

Enhanced productivity via integration with Excel, Teams, and SharePoint.

15. What security features does Power BI offer for sensitive data?

Row-Level Security (RLS): Restrict data access per user.

Azure AD authentication: Secure logins and permissions.

Data encryption: Both in transit and at rest.

Sensitivity labels and data loss prevention policies.

Auditing and activity logs for compliance.
