📘 1️⃣ What does DAX stand for?

DAX = Data Analysis Expressions

It’s a formula language used in Power BI, Power Pivot, and Analysis Services to create:

Calculated Columns

Measures

Tables

Custom aggregations and filters

💰 2️⃣ Write a DAX formula to sum the Sales column
Total Sales = SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales])


✅ Explanation:
SUM() adds up all values in the Sales column across the table.

🧮 3️⃣ Difference between a Calculated Column and a Measure
Feature	Calculated Column	Measure
Evaluation Context	Calculated row-by-row	Calculated on aggregate (filtered) context
Storage	Stored in the model (increases size)	Calculated on demand (no storage)
Use Case	Used for per-row computations	Used for KPIs, visuals, aggregations

Example:

Calculated Column → Profit = Sales – Cost

Measure → Total Profit = SUM(Sales) – SUM(Cost)

📊 4️⃣ Use DIVIDE() to calculate Profit Margin (Profit/Sales)
Profit Margin = DIVIDE(SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Profit]), SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]), 0)


✅ DIVIDE() safely handles division by zero.
If you don’t have a Profit column, calculate it dynamically:

Profit Margin = DIVIDE(SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]) - SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Cost]), SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]), 0)

🔢 5️⃣ What does COUNTROWS() do in DAX?

COUNTROWS() returns the number of rows in a table or filtered table.

Example:

Row Count = COUNTROWS(DAX_Practice_Data)


→ Returns 3 for your sample dataset.

💵 6️⃣ Create a measure: Total Profit (Total Sales – Total Cost)
Total Profit = SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]) - SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Cost])

📈 7️⃣ Measure: Average Sales per Product
Average Sales per Product = AVERAGE(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales])


✅ Or, to calculate total sales divided by distinct products:

Average Sales per Product = 
DIVIDE(SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]), DISTINCTCOUNT(DAX_Practice_Data[ProductID]))

🏷 8️⃣ Use IF() to tag products as "High Profit" if Profit > 1000

Calculated Column:

Profit Tag = IF(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales] - DAX_Practice_Data[Cost] > 1000, "High Profit", "Low Profit")


✅ Applies row by row.

⚠️ 9️⃣ What is a Circular Dependency Error?

A circular dependency occurs when a calculated column or measure depends on itself directly or indirectly — for example:

Column A = [Column B] + 1  
Column B = [Column A] + 1  


Power BI cannot compute either column because both rely on each other’s result.

⚙️ 🔟 Row Context vs. Filter Context
Context Type	Description	Example
Row Context	Evaluates expression for each row in a table	Profit = Sales - Cost
Filter Context	Evaluates after filters from visuals or slicers are applied	Total Sales = SUM(Sales) filtered by Region or Date

➡️ In short:

Row context = current row in the table.

Filter context = filters applied from the report visuals.

📅 11️⃣ Measure: YTD Sales using TOTALYTD()
YTD Sales = TOTALYTD(
    SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]),
    DAX_Practice_Data[Date]
)


✅ Calculates cumulative (year-to-date) sales for the year of each date in the dataset.

🔁 12️⃣ Dynamic Measure Switch (Sales / Profit / Margin)

Create a table manually:
Measure Selector

Measure Name
Sales
Profit
Margin

Create a measure:

Dynamic Measure =
SWITCH(
    SELECTEDVALUE(MeasureSelector[Measure Name]),
    "Sales", [Total Sales],
    "Profit", [Total Profit],
    "Margin", [Profit Margin]
)


Use this Dynamic Measure in visuals — controlled by a slicer on MeasureSelector[Measure Name].

⚡ 13️⃣ Optimize a Slow DAX Measure using Variables (VAR)

Before (inefficient):

Profit Margin = 
DIVIDE(SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]) - SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Cost]), SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]))


Optimized with VAR:

Profit Margin =
VAR TotalSales = SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales])
VAR TotalCost  = SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Cost])
RETURN
DIVIDE(TotalSales - TotalCost, TotalSales)


✅ Benefits: Variables compute once and reuse the result — improving performance and readability.

🧮 14️⃣ Use CALCULATE() to override a filter
All Region Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]),
    ALL(DAX_Practice_Data)
)


✅ CALCULATE() changes the filter context — here it removes all filters so you get the total sales across all regions.

🏆 15️⃣ Measure: Highest Sales Amount
Highest Sales = MAX(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales])


Or, if you want the product with highest sales:

Top Product Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    MAX(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]),
    FILTER(DAX_Practice_Data, DAX_Practice_Data[Sales] = MAX(DAX_Practice_Data[Sales]))
)

✅ Summary Table
Task	DAX Formula	Purpose
Total Sales	SUM([Sales])	Aggregate total sales
Total Profit	SUM([Sales]) - SUM([Cost])	Calculate overall profit
Profit Margin	DIVIDE(SUM([Sales])-SUM([Cost]), SUM([Sales]), 0)	Avoid division errors
Average Sales per Product	DIVIDE(SUM([Sales]), DISTINCTCOUNT([ProductID]))	Sales per unique product
Profit Tag	IF([Profit]>1000, "High","Low")	Classify rows
YTD Sales	TOTALYTD(SUM([Sales]), [Date])	Year-to-date calculation
Highest Sales	MAX([Sales])	Peak value
Dynamic Measure	SWITCH(SELECTEDVALUE(...))	Interactive metric selector
All Region Sales	CALCULATE(SUM([Sales]), ALL(...))	Ignore filters
