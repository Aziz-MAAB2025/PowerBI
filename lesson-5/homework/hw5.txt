1. What is a primary key in a table?

A primary key is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
✅ Example:

In Customer, the CustomerID uniquely identifies each customer.

In Products, the ProductID is the primary key.

2. Name the two types of table relationships in Power BI.

One-to-Many (1:*): One record in one table relates to many records in another.

Many-to-Many (:): Records in both tables can have multiple matches.

(There’s also One-to-One, but it’s less common.)

3. How do you create a relationship between two tables in Power BI?

Steps:

Go to Model view.

Drag and drop the related columns (e.g., CustomerID from Customer to Sales).

Power BI automatically detects the cardinality (e.g., One-to-Many).

✅ Result: a relationship line with “1” on the Customer side and “*” on the Sales side.

4. What is a "star schema"?

A star schema is a database design where:

A central Fact Table (e.g., Sales) stores quantitative data (measures).

Surrounding Dimension Tables (e.g., Customer, Products, Date) store descriptive attributes.

Visually, it looks like a star ⭐ — the fact table is in the center, connected to dimensions.

5. Which table is typically the fact table in a sales dataset?

✅ The Sales table is the Fact Table — it contains measurable business data such as Quantity, Revenue, and OrderDate.

6. Link Sales.csv to Customers.csv using CustomerID (one-to-many).

Customer[CustomerID] → Sales[CustomerID]

Relationship type: One-to-Many (1:*)

Cross filter direction: Single

✅ Each customer can have many sales.

7. Why is ProductID in Sales.csv a foreign key?

Because it refers to (or “points to”) a record in another table — the Products table.

Products.ProductID = primary key

Sales.ProductID = foreign key linking back to it.

This ensures each product in Sales exists in the Products table.

8. Fix a relationship error where ProductID has mismatched data types.

Solution:

Go to Model view → Column tools.

Ensure both Sales[ProductID] and Products[ProductID] have the same data type (e.g., Whole Number).

If not, change one using Power Query or DAX.

✅ Relationships require matching data types.

9. Explain why a star schema improves performance.

Simpler joins: Only one level of relationships between fact and dimensions.

Faster queries: Power BI’s VertiPaq engine compresses columns better.

Reduces ambiguity: No circular relationships.

Enables DAX optimization: Functions like RELATED and SUMMARIZE work efficiently.

10. Add a new column TotalSales in Sales (Quantity * Price from Products).

Use a calculated column (DAX):

TotalSales = Sales[Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Price])


✅ RELATED fetches the corresponding price from the Products table via the existing relationship.

11. Optimize a model with circular relationships — how would you resolve it?

Remove unnecessary links (keep one clear path).

Use DAX functions (e.g., USERELATIONSHIP()) instead of extra relationships.

Introduce bridge tables to break loops.
✅ Example: If both Sales → Products and Sales → Categories cause a loop, merge the category info into Products.

12. Create a role-playing dimension for OrderDate and ShipDate.

Steps:

Duplicate the Date table:

Date (Order)

Date (Ship)

Create separate relationships:

Sales[OrderDate] → Date (Order)[Date]

Sales[ShipDate] → Date (Ship)[Date]

✅ Allows different date analyses (e.g., Orders vs. Shipments).

13. Handle a many-to-many relationship between Customers and Products.

Since many customers can buy many products:

Create a bridge table like Sales that contains unique combinations of CustomerID and ProductID.

Use it to connect both Customers and Products indirectly.

✅ Avoids ambiguous relationships and allows aggregation through the bridge.

14. Use bidirectional filtering sparingly — when is it appropriate?

Use bidirectional filtering only when both tables need to filter each other for analysis.
✅ Example:

In a reporting matrix combining Customer and Product, enabling two-way filtering ensures totals match across both dimensions.
⚠️ Avoid using it everywhere — it increases complexity and risk of circular dependencies.

15. Write DAX to enforce referential integrity if a CustomerID is deleted.

You can use DAX to flag or handle missing customers:

IsCustomerValid = 
IF(
    ISBLANK(RELATED(Customer[Name])),
    "Missing Customer",
    "Valid"
)


✅ If a CustomerID in Sales no longer exists in Customer, it shows “Missing Customer”.

🔹 BONUS: Star Schema Example (Your Model)

Fact Table:
Sales (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, OrderDate)

Dimension Tables:

Customer (CustomerID, Name, Region)

Products (ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price)

Date (Date, Month, Year, Quarter)

Relationships:

Customer[CustomerID] → Sales[CustomerID] (1:*)

Products[ProductID] → Sales[ProductID] (1:*)

Date[Date] → Sales[OrderDate] (1:*)

✅ This model is efficient, scalable, and ready for DAX measures like:

Total Revenue = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Price]))
